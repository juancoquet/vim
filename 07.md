			 Lesson 7: SPICY COMBOS

these are some of my favourite, most useful motions.

these feel like when the mr. miyagi gets the karate kid to repeatedly to a bunch of pointless,
menial motions, but then suddenly they all comes together and he can now beat up other kids.

we will now figuratively beat up some kids.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the `f` key

use `f{some_char}` to jump to the next instance of {some_char} on the line you're on.

1. go to the beginning of the line below, and type `fX` to jump to the X and delete it.

oooooooooooooooooooooooooXooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo


after jumping to some character, pressing `;` will repeat the last jump, taking you to
the next instance of that character. pressing `,` will take you back to the previous instance.

2. go to the beginning of the line below, and delete the three Xes – first the middle one,
   the one on the right, and finally the one on the left.

oooooooooooooooooXooooooooooooooooooXooooooooooooooooooooXoooooooooooo


using `F` (capital) will do the same as all the above, but searching backwards instead of forwards.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the `f` key – combos

you can combine the `f` key with any of the operators. e.g. `df{some_char}` will
delete all text starting from where you are up to (and including) {some_char}.


1. delete all text up until the X.

oooooooooooooooooooooooooXooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo


this also works with any other operator.


bonus tip: `t` and `T` do the same as `f` and `F`, but they are _non-inclusive_.
they will take you up to, but not on, the specified char.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the `iw` combo:

`i` means inner, `w` means word.
append this to an operator to apply that operator to the word you are currently on.
note that you can be _anywhere_ on the word, not just the beginning of the word.

1. let's try it with the [d]elete operator. delete the capitalised word below,
   by navigating on top of it and hitting `diw`.
   for the sake of the exercise, navigate to the letter X in the middle of the word.

hello you are learning vim wow you are doing so well ABCXABC please delete that though

2. it also works with the `c` operator. again, navigate to the X and replace the word for 'well'

hello you are learning vim wow you are doing so ABCXABC please change that though

3. now with the `y` operator. move to the X, yank the word, and paste in on the line below.

hello you are learning vim wow you are doing so well ABCXABC
please copy the big word here: 



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the `i[`, `i{`, `i(` combos:

we can also use the [i]nner motion to operate inside brackets, braces, and parens.

note: for all examples below, i've included a copy of the exercise in 07ex.md.
this is because i've used the [{( without closing pairs characters to explain the concepts,
so now when we ask vim to 'delete stuff inside brackets' it doesn't quite know which brackets
we means

1. move to the line below, and [d]elete [i]nside [ the brackets:
   note: you do not have to be inside the brackets to perform the command.
	 the command will be applied to the nearest brackets on the line you're on.

hello here is some text [please delete this though]


2. move to the function call below, and change the passed param to `hello_vim`.
   you will need: [c]hange [i]nside [(] parenthesis.
   again, you do not need to be inside the parens to perform the combo.
   this one is super useful.

hello_world = "hello world"
hello_vim = "hello_vim"

print(hello_world)


3. move to the line below, and copy the dictionary contents into the empty dict below it.

a = {"hello": "world"}
b = {}


4. it also works for speech marks. move to the line below, and change the passed string to "hey vim"

print("hello world")

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
the `J` key

this one is easy but surprisingly useful.
it will bring up the line below and join it to the current line.

go to the first line below, and join all lines into one long one.

terrible poems
have line breaks in really
stupid places because for
some reason some people
think that
it's an artistic thing to
do.
