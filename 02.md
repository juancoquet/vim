			Lesson 2.1: DELETION COMMANDS


		       ** Type  dw  to delete a word. **

  1. Press  <ESC>  to make sure you are in Normal mode.

  2. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  3. Move the cursor to the beginning of a word that needs to be deleted.

  4. Type   dw	 to make the word disappear.

  NOTE: The letter  d  will appear on the last line of the screen as you type
	it.  Vim is waiting for you to type  w .  If you see another character
	than  d  you typed something wrong; press  <ESC>  and start over.

---> There are a some words fun that don't belong paper in this sentence.

  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the sentence is correct and go to lesson 2.2.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		      Lesson 2.2: MORE DELETION COMMANDS


	   ** Type  d$	to delete to the end of the line. **

note from juan: you can also do this with shift-d (capital D)

  1. Press  <ESC>  to make sure you are in Normal mode.

  2. Move the cursor to the line below marked --->.

  3. Move the cursor to the end of the correct line (AFTER the first . ).

  4. Type    d$    to delete to the end of the line.

---> Somebody typed the end of this line twice. end of this line twice.


  5. Move on to lesson 2.3 to understand what is happening.




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		     Lesson 2.3: ON OPERATORS AND MOTIONS

note from juan: this is what makes vim motions op – how operators and motions integrate together.
	        learn this concept, and you'll go _blazingly fast_™

  Many commands that change text are made from an operator and a motion.
  The format for a delete command with the  d  delete operator is as follows:

  	d   motion

  Where:
    d      - is the delete operator.
    motion - is what the operator will operate on (listed below).

  A short list of motions:
    w - until the start of the next word, EXCLUDING its first character.
    e - to the end of the current word, INCLUDING the last character.
    $ - to the end of the line, INCLUDING the last character.

  Thus typing  de  will delete from the cursor to the end of the word.

NOTE:  Pressing just the motion while in Normal mode without an operator will
       move the cursor as specified.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		     Lesson 2.4: USING A COUNT FOR A MOTION


   ** Typing a number before a motion repeats it that many times. **

  1. Move the cursor to the start of the line below marked --->.

  2. Type  2w  to move the cursor two words forward.

  3. Type  3e  to move the cursor to the end of the third word forward.

  4. Type  0  (zero) to move to the start of the line.

  5. Repeat steps 2 and 3 with different numbers.

---> This is just a line with words you can move around in.

  6. Move on to lesson 2.5.




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
		     Lesson 2.5: USING A COUNT TO DELETE MORE


   ** Typing a number with an operator repeats it that many times. **

  In the combination of the delete operator and a motion mentioned above you
  insert a count before the motion to delete more:
	 d   number   motion

  1. Move the cursor to the first UPPER CASE word in the line marked --->.

  2. Type  d2w  to delete the two UPPER CASE words.

  3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 with a different count to delete the consecutive
     UPPER CASE words with one command.

--->  this ABC DE line FGHI JK LMN OP of words is Q RS TUV cleaned up.





~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 Lesson 2.6: OPERATING ON LINES


		   ** Type  dd   to delete a whole line. **

  Due to the frequency of whole line deletion, the designers of Vi decided
  it would be easier to simply type two d's to delete a line.

  1. Move the cursor to the second line in the phrase below.
  2. Type  dd  to delete the line.
  3. Now move to the fourth line.
  4. Type   2dd   to delete two lines.

--->  1)  Roses are red,
--->  2)  Mud is fun,
--->  3)  Violets are blue,
--->  4)  I have a car,
--->  5)  Clocks tell time,
--->  6)  Sugar is sweet
--->  7)  And so are you.

Doubling to operate on a line also works for operators mentioned below.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			 Lesson 2.7: THE UNDO COMMAND


   ** Press  u	to undo the last commands,   U  to fix a whole line. **

  1. Move the cursor to the line below marked ---> and place it on the
     first error.
  2. Type  x  to delete the first unwanted character.
  3. Now type  u  to undo the last command executed.
  4. This time fix all the errors on the line using the  x  command.
  5. Now type a capital  U  to return the line to its original state.
  6. Now type  u  a few times to undo the  U  and preceding commands.
  7. Now type CTRL-R (keeping CTRL key pressed while hitting R) a few times
     to redo the commands (undo the undos).

---> Fiix the errors oon thhis line and reeplace them witth undo.

  8. These are very useful commands.  Now move on to the lesson 2 Summary.




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			       Lesson 2 SUMMARY

  1. To delete from the cursor up to the next word type:        dw
  2. To delete from the cursor up to the end of the word type:  de
  3. To delete from the cursor to the end of a line type:       d$
  4. To delete a whole line type:                               dd

  5. To repeat a motion prepend it with a number:   2w
  6. The format for a change command is:
               operator   [number]   motion
     where:
       operator - is what to do, such as  d  for delete
       [number] - is an optional count to repeat the motion
       motion   - moves over the text to operate on, such as  w (word),
		  e (end of word),  $ (end of the line), etc.

  7. To move to the start of the line use a zero:  0

  8. To undo previous actions, type:           u  (lowercase u)
     To undo all the changes on a line, type:  U  (capital U)
     To undo the undos, type:                  CTRL-R
