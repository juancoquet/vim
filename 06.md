			 Lesson 6.1: THE OPEN COMMAND

note from juan: this is a staple, super useful.

 ** Type  o  to open a line below the cursor and place you in Insert mode. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Type the lowercase letter  o  to open up a line BELOW the cursor and place
     you in Insert mode.

  3. Now type some text and press <ESC> to exit Insert mode.

---> After typing  o  the cursor is placed on the open line in Insert mode.

  4. To open up a line ABOVE the cursor, simply type a capital	O , rather
     than a lowercase  o.  Try this on the line below.

---> Open up a line above this by typing O while the cursor is on this line.




~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
			Lesson 6.2: THE APPEND COMMAND


	     ** Type  a  to insert text AFTER the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the start of the first line below marked --->.

  2. Press  e  until the cursor is on the end of  li .

  3. Type an  a  (lowercase) to append text AFTER the cursor.

  4. Complete the word like the line below it.  Press <ESC> to exit Insert
     mode.

  5. Use  e  to move to the next incomplete word and repeat steps 3 and 4.

---> This li will allow you to pract appendi text to a line.
---> This line will allow you to practice appending text to a line.

NOTE:  a, i and A all go to the same Insert mode, the only difference is where
       the characters are inserted.

		    Lesson 6.3: ANOTHER WAY TO REPLACE


      ** Type a capital  R  to replace more than one character. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.  Move the cursor to
     the beginning of the first  xxx .

  2. Now press  R  and type the number below it in the second line, so that it
     replaces the xxx .

  3. Press <ESC> to leave Replace mode.  Notice that the rest of the line
     remains unmodified.

  4. Repeat the steps to replace the remaining xxx.

---> Adding 123 to 456 gives you 579.
---> Adding 123 to 456 gives you 579.

NOTE:  Replace mode is like Insert mode, but every typed character deletes an
       existing character.

			Lesson 6.4: COPY AND PASTE TEXT

note from juan: 'yank' just means copy.

	  ** Use the  y  operator to copy text and  p  to paste it **

  1. Move to the line below marked ---> and place the cursor after "a)".

  2. Start Visual mode with  v  and move the cursor to just before "first".

  3. Type  y  to yank (copy) the highlighted text.

  note from juan: you don't need to highlight text to yank it. the yank operator works with any
		  motions, just like everying else in vim.
		  e.g. try `y5j` to yank the current line along with the 5 below it.
		  try `yy` to yank the current line.
		  try moving to the start of a word, and `ye` to yank to the end of the word.
		  we will get to some *spicy* combos towards the end.

  4. Move the cursor to the end of the next line:  j$

  5. Type  p  to put (paste) the text.  Then type:  a second <ESC> .

  6. Use Visual mode to select " item.", yank it with  y , move to the end of
     the next line with  j$  and put the text there with  p .

--->  a) this is the first item.
      b)

  NOTE: You can also use  y  as an operator:  yw  yanks one word,
        yy  yanks the whole line, then  p  puts that line.
