			 Lesson 3.1: THE PUT COMMAND

note from juan: this is just paste basically. think of [p]ut as [p]aste.
	        anything you delete with `d` gets automatically copied. `p` will paste it.
	        copying every deletion sounds weird at first, but it's _super_ powerful.

       ** Type	p  to put previously deleted text after the cursor. **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Type  dd  to delete the line and store it in a Vim register.

  3. Move the cursor to the c) line, ABOVE where the deleted line should go.

  4. Type   p   to put the line below the cursor.

  5. Repeat steps 2 through 4 to put all the lines in correct order.

---> d) Can you learn too?
---> b) Violets are blue,
---> c) Intelligence is learned,
---> a) Roses are red,

		       Lesson 3.2: THE REPLACE COMMAND

       ** Type  rx  to replace the character at the cursor with  x . **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Move the cursor so that it is on top of the first error.

  3. Type   r	and then the character which should be there.

  4. Repeat steps 2 and 3 until the first line is equal to the second one.

--->  Whan this lime was tuoed in, someone presswd some wrojg keys!
--->  When this line was typed in, someone pressed some wrong keys!

  5. Now move on to lesson 3.3.

NOTE: Remember that you should be learning by doing, not memorization.

			Lesson 3.3: THE CHANGE OPERATOR

note from juan: think of `c` and `d` as the same thing, except `c` will put you into `insert` mode
                after performing the deletion.

	   ** To change until the end of a word, type  ce . **

  1. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  2. Place the cursor on the  u  in  lubw.

  3. Type  ce  and the correct word (in this case, type  ine ).

  4. Press <ESC> and move to the next character that needs to be changed.

  5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until the first sentence is the same as the second.

---> This lubw has a few wptfd that mrrf changing usf the change operator.
---> This line has a few words that need changing using the change operator.

Notice that  ce  deletes the word and places you in Insert mode.
             cc  does the same for the whole line.

		       Lesson 3.4: MORE CHANGES USING c


     ** The change operator is used with the same motions as delete. **

  1. The change operator works in the same way as delete.  The format is:

         c    [number]   motion

  2. The motions are the same, such as   w (word) and  $ (end of line).

  3. Move the cursor to the first line below marked --->.

  4. Move the cursor to the first error.

  5. Type  c$  and type the rest of the line like the second and press <ESC>.

---> The end of this line needs some help to make it like the second.
---> The end of this line needs to be corrected using the  c$  command.

NOTE:  You can use the Backspace key to correct mistakes while typing.

			       Lesson 3 SUMMARY


  1. To put back text that has just been deleted, type   p .  This puts the
     deleted text AFTER the cursor (if a line was deleted it will go on the
     line below the cursor).

  2. To replace the character under the cursor, type   r   and then the
     character you want to have there.

  3. The change operator allows you to change from the cursor to where the
     motion takes you.  eg. Type  ce  to change from the cursor to the end of
     the word,  c$  to change to the end of a line.

  4. The format for change is:

	 c   [number]   motion

Now go on to the next lesson.
